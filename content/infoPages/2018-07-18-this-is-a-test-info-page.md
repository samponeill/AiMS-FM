  title: About us
---
Working in the Building Management and Facilities Maintenance Industry for over 20 years, we were looking for a software that could implement all the functionalities and tools required to improve the process of our business and help us to manage the expectations of our clients.

After testing and trialling endless different systems, we were unable to find a management software that was able to fulfil all our requirements, was user friendly, and easy to use.

So with this in mind we created our own system called AiMS.

With trialling and testing many different applications, we were able  to learn from the mistakes of other companies and create an all-in-one management system that is easy to use and can be customised to suit any user’s needs.
